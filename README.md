#                                   ---- Terraform AWS with Modules----

Commands---> terraform fmt -diff (its a best practice, before committ to github)
        ---> terraform init
        ---> terraform plan
        ---> terraform apply
        ---> terraform destory (destory everything, because amazon is not free bro, despite of its free tier.)
